"description": |
  Confluent Schema Registry provides a RESTful interface for developers to
  define standard schemas for their events, share them across the organization
  and safely evolve them in a way that is backward compatible and future proof.
  Schema Registry stores a versioned history of all schemas and allows the
  evolution of schemas according to the configured compatibility settings. It
  also provides a plugin to clients that handles schema storage and retrieval
  for messages that are sent in Avro format.
